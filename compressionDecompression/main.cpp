/**
 * From: https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/resources/former-interview-question-compression-and-decompression/#!
 *
 * 
 * In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed string.
 *
 * Your input is a compressed string of the format number[string] and the decompressed output form should be the string written number times. For example:
 *
 * The input:
 * 3[abc]4[ab]c
 *
 * Would be output as:
 * abcabcabcababababc
 * 
 * Other rules:
 * * Number can have more than one digit. For example, 10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa
 * * One repetition can occur inside another. For example, 2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab
 * * Characters allowed as input include digits, small English letters and brackets [ ].
 * * Digits are only to represent amount of repetitions.
 * * Letters are just letters.
 * * Brackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated substring.
 * * Input is always valid, so no need to check its validity.
 *
 * Learning objectives:
 *
 * This question gives you the chance to practice with strings, recursion, algorithm, compilers, automata, and loops. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to work on coding with better efficiency.
